Homogeneous Neural Networks
===========================

Neural networks are probably the most popular machine learning
algorithms in recent years. FATE provides a federated homogeneous neural
network implementation. We simplified the federation process into three
parties. Party A represents Guestï¼Œwhich acts as a task trigger. Party B
represents Host, which is almost the same with guest except that Host
does not initiate task. Party C serves as a coordinator to aggregate
models from guest/hosts and broadcast aggregated model.

Basic Process
-------------

As its name suggested, in Homogeneous Neural Networks, the feature
spaces of guest and hosts are identical. An optional encryption mode for
model is provided. By doing this, no party can get the private model of
other parties.

![Figure 1 (Federated Homo NN
Principle)](../../doc/images/homo_nn.png){.align-center width="500px"}

The Homo NN process is shown in Figure 1. Models of Party A and Party B
have the same neural networks structure. In each iteration, each party
trains its model on its own data. After that, all parties upload their
encrypted (with random mask) model parameters to arbiter. The arbiter
aggregates these parameters to form a federated model parameter, which
will then be distributed to all parties for updating their local models.
Similar to traditional neural network, the training process will stop
when the federated model converges or the whole training process reaches
a predefined max-iteration threshold.

Please note that random numbers are carefully generated so that the
random numbers of all parties add up an zero matrix and thus disappear
automatically. For more detailed explanations, please refer to [\[Secure
Analytics: Federated Learning and Secure
Aggregation\].](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs261/fa18/scribe/10_15.pdf)
Since there is no model transferred in plaintext, except for the owner
of the model, no other party can obtain the real information of the
model.

:::

Since all parties training Homogeneous Neural Networks have the same
network structure, a common practice is to configure parameters under
algorithm\_parameters, which is shared across all parties. The basic
structure is:

    {
          "config_type": "nn",
          "nn_define": [layer1, layer2, ...]
          "batch_size": -1,
          "optimizer": optimizer,
          "early_stop": {
            "early_stop": early_stop_type,
            "eps": 1e-4
          },
          "loss": loss,
          "metrics": [metrics1, metrics2, ...],
          "max_iter": 10
    }
